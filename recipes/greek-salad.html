        <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
        <p>This tasty Greek salad made with cucumbers, tomatoes, red onion, olives, and feta
            is so refreshing and perfect for the summer. The best tip I can give you is to toss
            everything with the red wine vinegar before adding olive oil to get the best flavor.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large cucumbers</li>
            <li>1 pinch kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 cups cherry tomatoes</li>
            <li>1/4 red onion</li>
            <li>1/2 red bell pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pitted Kalamata olives</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pitted green olives</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh oregano</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1 (4 ounce) package feta cheese, diced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh oregano</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel off a few strips of cucumber skin using a channel
                 knife, creating a striped pattern. Cut cucumbers in half 
                 crosswise. Cut each half into quarters before cutting into 
                 1/4- to 1/2-inch slices. Place into a colander; toss with 
                 some kosher salt and let sit for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cut cherry tomatoes in half. Rinse cucumbers; 
                drain thoroughly for 10 to 15 minutes more. </li>
            <li>While cucumbers are draining, slice onion thinly. Cut bell 
                pepper into strips. Turn knife diagonally and cut strips into 
                diamond-shaped pieces. Slice Kalamata and green olives. </li>  
            <li> Combine cucumbers, tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, olives, and 
                2 tablespoons oregano in a bowl. Season with salt, black pepper, 
                and cayenne. Sprinkle in vinegar and toss thoroughly. Drizzle in olive 
                oil. Add about 2/3 of the feta cheese and toss again. Cover with plastic
                 wrap and refrigerate for 30 to 60 minutes. </li>  
            <li>Give the salad another mix. Taste and season as desired. 
                Scatter remaining feta cheese on top and garnish with remaining oregano. </li>
        </ol>
